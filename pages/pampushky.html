    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>15 grams fresh yeast or 7g (¼ oz) dried active yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon caster sugar</li>
        <li>225 millilitres warm water</li>
        <li>400 grams strong white flour , plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>20 grams wet (new) or regular garlic , crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First make a ‘sponge’, which is a type of yeasty starter. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the measurement water (make sure it’s blood temperature – hot water would kill the yeast!). Add 200g (7oz) of the flour and mix roughly. Cover with clingfilm and leave to prove in the refrigerator overnight.</li>
        <li>The next morning, add the rest of the flour and fine sea salt to the starter and knead on a well-floured work surface until the dough is smooth and comes away from your hands easily.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 8 pieces and shape into round buns. Put them side by side in an oiled round ovenproof dish or a 24cm (9½ inch) round cake tin, cover and let them prove again, this time in a warm place, until doubled in size. They will join together just like hot cross buns do.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/Gas Mark 7. To make the basting oil, simply stir the crushed garlic through the oil with a small pinch of sea salt and the parsley, then let it infuse.</li>
        <li>When the pampushky look plump and ready, brush them generously with some beaten egg to glaze and bake for 20–25 minutes or until they form a glistening golden crust. Take them out and baste them with the garlic oil. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
